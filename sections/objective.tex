% Objective Statement
%====================
I am a software engineer with experience in both software and hardware integration and testing. I am currently pursuing my MS in computer science part-time, online at Georgia Tech, where I am focusing on low-level computing systems. I have strong knowledge in C and C++, and have used Python in development of system testing. I feel most comfortable in lower level systems, and also have knowledge of cryptographic engineering.
